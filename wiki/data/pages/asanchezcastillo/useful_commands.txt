===== Import ROOT from Python: ======

When using import ROOT in python it is mandatory that the python version for which root was built is the same as the installed in your computer. You can check your this using:

root-config --has-pyroot (To check if there is a built python version)

root-config --python-version (To check which version it is)

After that you need to install the corresponding version and run these:

source /usr/local/bin/thisroot.sh (the location of thisroot.sh can change, but you can echo it by running which root)

ln -s -f /usr/local/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python

exec $SHELL -l

python --version (To check that the version has changed)
