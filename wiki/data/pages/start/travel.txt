====== Info for travelling ======

  * Before **any** travel, it's **crucial** that you fill the appropriate form (otherwise you won't be refunded for your expenses or covered under a travel insurance). It's called **Perlico** and can be accessed through the University Virtual Office: [[https://oficinavirtual.ugr.es/ai/|Oficina Virtual]]
  * You need to do this well in advance, and before making any other travel arrangements (such as registration, booking a flight, etc.)
  * You will be asked for some information, such as the travel dates and means of travelling, but also on the project (//Centro de Gasto//) that will be covering the expenses
