====== Obtaining an investigator profile ======

To obtain access to an investigator profile, send an email serviciopdi@ugr.es. You must include your name, surname, NIF and start date of the contract (if it is your first time in the UGR). To allow servers to update your personal information, wait a couple of days from the formalization of the contract to start this procedure.
