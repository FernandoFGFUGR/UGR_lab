					<h2><a href="https://www.ugr.es/personal/antonio-bueno-villar" class="enlace" target="_blank">Prof. Antonio Bueno Villar</a></h2> 
					<div class="description-two">
						<br><p>Antonio received his Ph.D. from University of Valencia. After a postdoctoral training at the University of Harvard and ETH Zürich, he joined the University of Granada in 2002. This marked the onset of activities on experimental particle and astroparticle physics at this university. Currently he is Full Professor of Physics. His research interests cover the physics of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (he was co-spokesperson of the Pierre Auger Observatory from 2013 to 2017) and neutrino physics (he was part of the team that originally developed the first ICARUS T600 liquid argon TPC module). Now, he is a member of the <a href="https://sbn-nd.fnal.gov/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">SBND</a> and <a href="https://www.dunescience.org/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">DUNE</a> collaborations.</p>

					<br><h2><a href="https://www.ugr.es/personal/diego-garcia-gamez" class="enlace" target="_blank">Dr. Diego García Gámez</a></h2> 
					<div class="description-two">
						<p>Diego is Associate Professor at the University of Granada. He joined the Experimental Particle Physics group at the UGR in November 2018 under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie COFUND Actions programme, ATHENEA3i. His research focuses on the study of neutrinos using liquid argon time projection chambers as detection technology (within the international collaborations <a href="https://sbn-nd.fnal.gov/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">SBND</a>, <a href="https://www.dunescience.org/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">DUNE</a> and MicroBooNE), with a strong interest in extending the use of light signals to improve the time, calorimetric and spatial resolution in these detectors. Before arriving in Granada, he carried out two postdoctoral stays. The first at the Laboratoire de l'Accélérateur linéaire (CNRS/University of Paris Sud) in the field of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (within the Pierre Auger experiment), and the second at the University of Manchester (UK) in the field of neutrino physics and detector design and construction.</p>

					<div class="description-two">
						<p>Patricia joined the group in January 2022 as a Juan de la Cierva Researcher. Her field of expertise lies on instrumentation for liquid noble gas detectors, in particular in the use of novel photosensors. Before moving to Granada, she spent 4 years as a postdoc in the University of Zurich, where she was involved on developing R&D for DARWIN, the future European Observatory for dark matter and neutrino physics. Prior this, Patricia received her PhD at the University of Granada, with a focus on ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Besides the development of new detection technologies, her main research interests are neutrino physics and rare-event searches. Her other passions are sharing time with her friends, traveling and practising yoga.</p>

						<p>Bruno returned to his alma mater in 2018, where he is now an Associate Professor. Before that, he spent 3 years as a postdoc at the University of Sussex, where he was one of the main analysers of neutrino oscillations in the NOvA experiment. He also had a break working as a Data Scientist for multinational companies Willis Towers Watson and IQVIA. In addition to developing software for neutrino oscillation analysis, he is interested in precision measurements of neutrino interactions and searches of new Physics within the neutrino sector. In his free time he enjoys reading, videogames and DJing.</p>
